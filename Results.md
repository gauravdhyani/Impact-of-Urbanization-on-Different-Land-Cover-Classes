##  Results Summary  

### 1. Classification Accuracy  
- **Overall Accuracy**: **95.39%**  
- **Kappa Accuracy**: **94.24%**  
 Classifier performed very well in distinguishing land cover classes.  

### 2. Change Detection  
- Significant changes observed between **2022 → 2023**, especially in **Urban** and **Vegetation** classes.  
- **Urban area** increased → ongoing urbanization.  
- **Vegetation** decreased → likely due to expansion into green zones.  
- **Bareland** increased → agricultural/natural land converted to urban use.  
- **Water** area decreased → possibly linked to land use changes or management practices.  

### 3. Area Calculations  

| Class       | 2022 (sq km) | 2023 (sq km) | Change (sq km) |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Urban       | 453.01       | 481.69       | **+28.68**     |
| Water       | 117.00       | 105.68       | **-11.32**     |
| Vegetation  | 669.72       | 621.20       | **-48.52**     |
| Forest      | 183.35       | 198.45       | **+15.10**     |
| Bareland    | 64.64        | 80.70        | **+16.06**     |

 These reflect clear shifts in **land use and urban development trends**.

## Discussion  

### 1. Urbanization Trends  
- **Urban expansion** is rapid in Delhi-NCR.  
- **Vegetation loss** and **bareland growth** suggest conversion for infrastructure & housing.  

### 2. Environmental Impact  
- **Declining vegetation & forest cover** → risk of biodiversity loss, reduced carbon sequestration, and urban heat island effects.  
- Increase in **forest patches** (reforestation efforts) is a **positive counter-trend**.  

### 3. Water Management  
- **Water body shrinkage** → highlights urgent need for sustainable water management strategies.  
- Natural lakes/ponds are increasingly fragmented.  

### 4. Future Implications  
- If unchecked, **urban sprawl** may worsen air quality, water scarcity, and ecological degradation.  
- Requires **integrated urban planning**:  
  - Green infrastructure  
  - Water conservation  
  - Sustainable construction practices  

### 5. Role of Remote Sensing  
- Remote sensing + GEE proved highly effective for **tracking urban growth and LULC changes**.  
- Provides scalable, reproducible insights for **evidence-based policymaking**.

 **Conclusion**: Delhi experienced **rapid urban expansion from 2022–2023**, accompanied by **loss of vegetation & water bodies**, but also **some forest recovery**.  
Remote sensing & GEE are critical tools for **monitoring and sustainable urban planning**.
